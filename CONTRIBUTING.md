# Welcome to Bqckup Contributing Guide

## Make Changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes
3. 
## Commit your update
Once you are satisfied with the changes made, commit them. It is also advisable to conduct a self-review prior to submission to expedite the review process

## Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
1. Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.

2. Remember to link your pull request (PR) to the right issue if there's one. And don't forget to tick the box that lets the maintainers make changes to your branch. This way, it'll be easier to merge your changes. Once you submit your PR, we'll take a good look at it and might ask you some questions or need more information

3. Before a PR can be merged, we might ask you to make some changes. We'll either give you suggestions or leave comments on your pull request. You can easily make the suggested changes directly in the user interface. For any other changes, you can make them in your own copy of the code, then you can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

4. As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved
